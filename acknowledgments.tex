I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisors, Professors Hui Yang, Arno Puder, and Anagha Kulkarni. Their patience, support, and confidence in me have been invaluable throughout my graduate journey at SFSU. I also owe a special debt of gratitude to Professor Tao He, whose crucial suggestion to incorporate a global similarity metric with the embedding vectors significantly improved the model's classification performance.

This research was supported by the work of many individuals. I extend my sincere thanks to Natalie Yam, Parth Panchal, and Joanne Park for their assistance with data collection, compilation, and preliminary analysis. I am also grateful to the Program Pathways Mapper (PPM) team, which includes representatives from the Kern Community College District, the Foundation for California Community Colleges, and the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, for their partnership and for providing the foundational data for this work.

On a personal note, I am immensely thankful for my dear friends who have been there for me through thick and thin, cheering me on whenever I felt I could not continue. To my good friend, Phil, I offer my deepest appreciation for his incredible generosity and support, which made navigating the financial challenges of graduate school possible. Finally, I am profoundly grateful to Julie and Bita for their invaluable guidance and perspective, which were instrumental to my personal growth and well-being throughout this journey.
