\begin{abstract}
The manual process of determining course equivalency is a significant barrier to student mobility and educational equity, leading to substantial credit loss and delayed graduation that disproportionately harms underrepresented students. Previous automated approaches have been limited by a reliance on sensitive student enrollment records or the operational intractability and opacity of using large language models for direct classification.

This thesis introduces and validates a novel framework that overcomes these challenges by decoupling semantic representation from classification, using only publicly available course catalog data. The methodology leverages deep metric learning to fine-tune contextual embedding models on public course text. These specialized embeddings are then used to construct a novel composite distance vector, which serves as a rich feature set for training traditional machine learning classifiers.

Evaluated on a real-world dataset, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, with \(F_1\)-scores exceeding 0.99. The result is a computationally efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution that provides institutions with a practical tool to automate course articulation, reduce administrative burden, and foster a more equitable educational ecosystem.
