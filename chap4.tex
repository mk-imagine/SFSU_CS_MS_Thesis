\chapter{Experimental Setup and Results}
This chapter presents the empirical results that validate the decoupled, deep metric learning framework proposed in Chapter 3. Having detailed the systematic methodology, we now turn to the execution and outcomes of the multi-stage evaluation plan. The central objective of this chapter is to systematically assess the performance of each component of the pipeline---from the choice of embedding model and the impact of fine-tuning to the effects of dimensionality reduction and the selection of a downstream classifier---to identify the optimal configuration for both classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

The analysis is structured to first establish the validity of the core feature engineering approach before proceeding through the comparative stages of the evaluation. The chapter begins by detailing the computational environment, datasets, and formal evaluation metrics used throughout the experiments. It then immediately presents a critical ablation study to validate the efficacy of the novel composite distance vector (\(\Delta_c\)), the cornerstone of the feature representation. With the feature vector's design validated, the chapter then follows the primary evaluation sequence: first, establishing a baseline by assessing the performance of various off-the-shelf embedding models and classifiers; second, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fine-tuning; and third, analyzing the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency introduced by dimensionality reduction. The chapter culminates in a definitive comparative analysis on the held-out test data, synthesizing all prior findings to identify the single best-performing pipeline configuration. We begin by outlining the experimental setup that forms the foundation for all subsequent results.

\section{Experimental Environment \& Datasets}
\subsection{Computational Environment}
The research presented in this thesis was conducted using a hybrid computational environment, leveraging both cloud-based services for initial language model evaluations and a powerful on-premise high-performance computing (HPC) cluster for the primary, computationally intensive experiments. The initial direct classification tasks described in Section 3.1 were performed using Google's Gemini v1.0, a proprietary cloud-based Large Language Model. All subsequent stages of the research, including model fine-tuning, embedding generation, dimensionality reduction, and the comprehensive downstream classifier evaluations, were executed on San Francisco State University's ``POLARIS'' High Performance Compute Cluster.

The POLARIS cluster provided a robust and flexible environment, running on Rocky Linux 8.9 with the Slurm Workload Manager for job scheduling. The GPU-intensive deep learning tasks, particularly the fine-tuning of the embedding models, were performed on the \verb|gpucluster node|. This node is equipped with two AMD EPYC 9334 CPUs (providing 64 cores and 128 threads), 1 TB of RAM, and is accelerated by four NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each with 80 GB of VRAM and supported by CUDA v12.4. The extensive hyperparameter grid searches for the traditional machine learning classifiers were primarily run on the \verb|cpucluster|, which consists of three nodes, each powered by two AMD EPYC 9534 CPUs (128 cores, 256 threads) and containing 576 GB of RAM. The cluster nodes are interconnected with a high-speed InfiniBand 200 Gb/s network, ensuring efficient data transfer during distributed tasks.

The entire experimental pipeline was implemented in Python, with Jupyter Notebooks serving as the primary environment for rapid prototyping, initial data exploration, and results analysis. The core deep learning components were built using PyTorch, with extensive use of the Hugging Face ecosystem, including the \verb|Transformers|, \verb|Sentence-Transformers|, and \verb|Hub| libraries for model access and training. The classical machine learning experiments were conducted using \verb|scikit-learn| and \verb|XGBoost|. Data manipulation and analysis were handled with \verb|numpy| and \verb|pandas|, while \verb|plotly| was used for visualization and \verb|dill| for object serialization.

\subsection{Datasets}
The evolutionary methodology described in Chapter~\ref{ch:3} was developed and validated using two distinct datasets, each serving a critical purpose at different stages of the research. The use of a smaller, initial dataset for prototyping followed by a larger, more comprehensive corpus for final evaluation is a core component of the experimental design. Table~\ref{tbl:datasets} provides a comparative summary of the key characteristics of both datasets used in this research.

\subsubsection{Initial Dataset}
The first dataset, hereafter referred to as the Initial Dataset, was a manually curated corpus used for the preliminary investigations in Stages 1 and 2 of the evaluation framework. This dataset was constructed from five lower-division courses at San Francisco State University and their established articulation agreements from 63 other California public colleges, sourced via the ASSIST repository. It was used to establish the initial performance baseline with the direct LLM classification approach and to prototype the decoupled pipeline. The final evaluation set for these preliminary stages consisted of a balanced, stratified random sample of 400 course pairs drawn from a larger set of over 11,000 generated pairs.

\subsubsection{PPM Corpus}
The primary and definitive experiments for this thesis were conducted on the PPM Corpus, a larger and more robust dataset provided by the Program Pathways Mapper (PPM). This corpus served as the foundation for the full-scale implementation, fine-tuning, and final validation of the decoupled pipeline (Stages 3 and 4). After a filtering process detailed in Section~\ref{ch:3.2.1}, the final corpus consists of 2,157 courses, each labeled with a Course Identification Number (C-ID) that serves as the ground truth for equivalency. This corpus was partitioned via a stratified 50/50 split into a training set of 1,078 courses and a held-out test set of 1,079 courses. This held-out test set is crucial for methodological rigor and was used only once for the final, conclusive evaluation of the optimized pipelines to provide an honest and unbiased estimate of their generalization performance.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
To facilitate a comprehensive and multi-faceted analysis, a suite of standard evaluation metrics was used to assess the various pipeline configurations. These metrics were chosen to measure performance across two critical dimensions: classification efficacy and computational efficiency, ensuring that the final recommended pipeline is not only accurate but also practical for real-world deployment.

\subsubsection{Classification Efficacy}
The core assessment of classification performance is based on a standard suite of metrics derived from the confusion matrix, which tabulates the counts of True Positives (\(TP\)), True Negatives (\(TN\)), False Positives (\(FP\)), and False Negatives (\(FN\)). Figure~\ref{} provides a visual representation of this structure. By convention throughout this thesis, the true (actual) class labels are organized along the vertical y-axis, and the labels predicted by the model are organized along the horizontal x-axis.  While Accuracy, defined as \(\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\), provides a general overview of correctness, it can be insufficient for capturing the nuances of a classifier's behavior. Therefore, this research also evaluates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precision}: Calculated as \(\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\), this metric measures a model's exactness. High precision indicates that when the model predicts an equivalency, it is likely to be correct.
    \item \textbf{Recall}: Calculated as \(\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\), this metric measures a model's completeness. High recall indicates that the model is effective at identifying the full set of all true equivalencies.
\end{itemize}
The \(F_1\)-Score, the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall (\(2\cdot\frac{Precision\cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}\)), is used as the primary metric for reporting and comparing the final classification performance. The \(F_1\)-Score provides a single, robust value that balances the trade-off between precision and recall, making it an ideal metric for this task where both avoiding false equivalencies and identifying all true ones are important.

\subsubsection{Efficiency Metric}
Beyond classification efficacy, the practical viability of each pipeline was assessed by measuring its computational efficiency. Both Training Time and Inference Time were systematically captured during the hyperparameter tuning process using the detailed statistics provided by \verb|scikit-learn| \!\!'s \verb|GridSearchCV| utility. Training time reflects the resources required to fit a model configuration, offering insight into the cost of experimentation. Inference time, reported by \verb|GridSearchCV| as \verb|score_time|, measures the time required for a trained model to make predictions on new data. For the use case of this research, inference time is considered the more critical efficiency metric, as it directly impacts the system's real-world responsiveness and scalability in a production environment. Finally, for the specific task of monitoring model improvement during the fine-tuning process (Stage 3), a specialized metric, Average Precision based on cosine similarity, was employed by the \verb|BinaryClassificationEvaluator| to select the best-performing model checkpoint.

\section{Direct LLM Classification}
The initial phase of this research sought to establish a performance baseline by evaluating the feasibility of using a Large Language Model for end-to-end course equivalency classification. The experiments were conducted using the Initial Dataset, a balanced 400-pair sample, and leveraged Google's Gemini Pro v1.0 as the reasoning engine. The evaluation was designed to test two key conditions: the impact of input data type (full raw text vs.\ extracted topics) and the effect of different classification schemes (binary, 3-way, and 4-way) on the model's performance and behavior.

The classification results were encouraging, with the model achieving a peak accuracy of 90.5\% in the binary task using raw text. A primary finding from this phase was that using the full, unprocessed raw text consistently yielded superior results compared to using only the extracted structured topics. This performance gap is likely attributable to the challenges inherent in the data extraction step itself. The process of deducing structured topics from unstructured text proved to be the most time-consuming and difficult aspect of this initial approach, requiring two to four times more time than the classification task and exhibiting a high sensitivity to prompt wording—a finding that aligns with previous studies on prompt engineering by Sclar et al., Errica et al., Chen et al., Cheung, and Gerych et al.~\cite{Sclar2023QuantifyingLM,Errica2024WhatDI,Chen2024LLMAA,Cheung2024ARC,Gerych2024WhoKT}. Although Gemini demonstrated a general capability to understand the context of the course descriptions, its limitations in flawlessly deducing course topics appear to have introduced enough noise to degrade the performance of the topics-based classification.

An analysis of the confusion matrices, presented in Figure~\ref{fig:cm} reveals a consistent and telling behavioral pattern: the model exhibits a strong conservative bias. Across all scenarios, the ``not equivalent'' class showed higher recall than precision, while the ``equivalent'' class showed higher precision than recall. For example, in the binary raw text evaluation, the model produced 34 false negatives but only 4 false positives. This indicates that the model is far more likely to misclassify a truly equivalent course as ``not equivalent'' than it is to incorrectly approve a non-equivalent pair. This conservative tendency suggests the LLM operates with a high internal threshold for declaring equivalency, preferring to err on the side of caution.

The introduction of the ``unsure'' and ``insufficient data'' categories was designed to simulate how a human advisor might handle ambiguity. While there is no ground truth for these labels, their value lies in the model's ability to isolate cases that require further manual review. This is particularly relevant for courses that may have significant topical overlap but different learning outcomes, or for descriptions that are too sparse to allow for a definitive decision. For instance, in the 4-way raw text evaluation, the model flagged 46 pairs as ``unsure'' and 12 as having ``insufficient'' information, effectively separating these ambiguous cases from the main classification flow.  Table~\ref{tbl:llm_results_summary} provides a comprehensive summary of the performance metrics for all six experimental conditions.

To contextualize the performance of Gemini Pro, a comparative analysis was conducted against a suite of other prominent open-source LLMs (see Table~\ref{tbl:cls} for a summary of their specifications and performance). The results of this benchmark revealed that Gemini Pro v1.0 outperformed all other models tested. While most models were able to complete the task, their performance varied significantly. The strongest competitor was Anthracite Magnum v1 72B, which achieved a respectable accuracy of 85.25\%, but still falling short of Gemini's 90.5\%.

This benchmark also highlighted significant operational challenges. Several models struggled to reliably produce valid output. For example, Google's Gemma 2 27B consistently generated unintelligible or irrelevant responses, preventing the collection of any meaningful performance data. Similarly, Meta's Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model was only able to respond correctly to approximately 52\% of the prompts, making it too unreliable for practical use. A surprising insight from this analysis was the lack of a strong correlation between model size and performance on this task. It is important to note, however, that the prompts used in this evaluation were originally designed and optimized for Gemini. This lack of prompt specificity for the other models may have contributed to their lower accuracy and, in some cases, their inability to respond appropriately.

This initial study confirmed that direct LLM classification can achieve high accuracy but is sensitive to input quality and exhibits a conservative bias. More importantly, it validated the fundamental limitations of the approach, its computational cost, lack of a quantifiable similarity score, and ``black box'' nature, that motivated the development of the decoupled pipeline. The following sections will now present the results of this more advanced framework, beginning with a critical validation of its most novel component: the composite distance vector.
